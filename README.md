# Web-Scrapping

### Technology Used:
  Language used: Python
  Editor Used: Pycharm
  Python Version: 3.8.0
  Pre-requisite: BeutifulSoap Library
  
### Details:
  1) I have used BeutifulSoap to parse the HTML and extract the values for Movie name & Ratings.
  2) From IMDB website inspect the rating page the html tags and its class name for movie name and its ratings.
  3) The program accepts the movie name & prints its rating.
  4) Additionally, I have exported the full list of movies & ratings in a CSV file.
  
Note: The web page displays first 250 movie details. So, I have exported the same list to CSV.

### Run Program:
  1) The Program ask you to enter a movie name
  2) You don’t need to enter full movie name. Just input a word from movie name & it will print all the movies matching the name e.g. “The”
  3) A CSV file “index.csv” will be created at the path where you’re running the program.
  The CSV file has a full list of movies & its ratings
